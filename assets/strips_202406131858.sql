Angry Bob was angry. Very, very angry. He went to the Waffle Barn and ordered two waffles but they did not make him happy.

He went to the park. It was sunny. He sat on the warm grass and took off his shoes and smoked a cigarette.
It felt good.

He spotted the hot dog stand. "I will buy a hot dog and a lemonade and read a book," he said. "Then I will be happy." 

Bob ate his hot dog and drank his lemonade. He put on his glasses and began to read his book. The happiness that had eluded Angry Bob for 33 years was finally his.

A Frisbee smashed into Bob''s face. Bob choked on the hot dog and died.

I recently received a form letter from you saying that you had rejected my manuscript,"The Adventures of Angry Bob."

As a professional myself, I realize that you have a job to do and have to make close judgment calls like this on a daily basis. Thus, I am not one to whine.

At the same time, I am sure you realize what a gut-level book that "Angry Bob" could revolutionize publishing.

For now, why don''t you share with me your thought process in this regard and let us see what we can do to move this project forward.

Dear Sir,
You are the worst writer I have seen in 46 years in the publishing business.
May a bus run you over.

Today''s Lesson:
"Avoiding the Hug Precedent"

YOU ARE WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE... YOU SPOT SOMEONE YOU JUST MET... AND, SUDDENLY, YOU ALL SORT OF KNOW... HEY, IT''S BOB.

THOUGHTLESSLY, A MEMBER OF YOUR GROUP HUGS THIS INDIVIDUAL, THEREBY SETTING THE HUG PRECEDENT... EACH MEMBER OF YOUR GROUP MUST NOW HUG THIS PERSON, OR RISK LOOKING RUDE!

TO AVOID THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION, SIMPLY FOLLOW THESE EASY STEPS...


FIRST, SHAKE YOUR BODY VIOLENTLY.

SECOND, ROLL YOUR EYES WAY BACK INTO YOUR HEAD.

THIRD, FALL TO THE FLOOR AND LAY VERY STILL.

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU ARE NOW FAKING YOUR OWN DEATH!

WITH ANY LUCK, THE GROUP WILL DECIDE TO NOT HUG SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEMINGLY DIED, AND WILL MOVE ON TO SOMEONE WEE BEFORE SEEING YOU AND WON''T THEN WANT TO WATCH.

WHEN YOU''RE SURE EVERYONE IS GONE, GET UP SLOWLY AND LEAVE.

AVOID STRAGGLERS.

I''m your biggest fan and have begun knitting my own lion scarves in your honor.

Tired of dying, Angry Bob undied and returned to the bar where he had died just a week earlier.

"It''s so dumb to set yourself on fire to impress a woman," he thought.

"To impress a woman, one must be indifferent and elusive. Not an easy skill."

Thus, Angry Bob sat quietly, sat quietly ''til his mind had wandered and fallen off the track and walked awkwardly to the jukebox.

Two women followed. Angry Bob tepidly pushed some buttons, whacked the side,
and stood hoping.

Eight more women followed Bob went to the men''s room.

Fourteen women stood outside the door. Angry Bob walked out and went straight to
the pool table.

Seventy-one women surrounded the table. Angry Bob had died and returned more knowledgeable.

Thus, Angry Bob silently surveyed the fine selection of beauties surrounding him and made the fatal error of trying to save
a hair from his forehead ...

...for the surging throng of beauties had crushed him against the bar.

Bob snapped like a toothpick and died.

... and felt an acute shortage of breath.

So far, you''ve only bombed two.

Even if you win re-election, you only have 65 months left in office.

If we are to get them all, you will need to bomb three per month from here on out. 

For us to sustain that kind of pace, you will need to stop wasting time asking the U.N. and Congress for approval. They are silly girly-girls.

P.S. If we have extra time, I suggest hitting France more than once.

No wasted panels. No boring set-up dialogue. Just pure punchline...We hope you enjoy.

So Angry Bob went to Hawaii

This is nice. I got a little hotel room

It was not "so nice." It was the "I do not like this" hotel

Angry Bob went to his hotel bar overlooking the ocean. And he drank. Soon, he was happy

After a few more drinks, Bob decided to use the bathroom. "Second door to the right," said the bartender

Angry Bob walked down the hall, a tear of joy running down his drunken cheek

So this is what it is like to be truly happy, Bob exclaimed, as he touched the third door on the left, which led out the back of the bar and straight down into the ocean

Angry Bob fell into the cold, dark sea. Drowning, Bob realized that the same booze that had brought him such bountiful joy had also disguised its evil side. Lesson learned, Bob died

Angry Bob was angry. He went to the zoo.

Bob bought a pretzel and a can of soda pop and sat on a green bench facing the monkey cage. The hungry monkeys stared at Bob.

It is a good day for the zoo, Bob thought. I am sweating and the pretzels are warm and the soda is refreshing.

I am happy, Bob exclaimed. I thought a warm pretzel and a refreshing soda pop would do it. All it took was a warm pretzel and a refreshing soda and a comfortable bench by the monkey cage.

A projectile struck Bob in the ear. A monkey screeched. More projectiles followed. Bob ran...

...straight into the path of the zoo''s biannual Parade of Elephants.

I am in receipt of the next
three chapters of your saga
Of Angry Bob, which you
submitted to us for possible
publication.

Please be advised that we here
at the New Yorker have plumbed the
lifeless prose of hacks such as
John Updike, Joan Didion and
Norman Mailer.

Why just this morning we thought
to ourselves, "What we really need
is something written by someone
with a third-grade education
discussing the merits of
tossing their own excrement
at zoo animals."

Imagine our surprise
when we opened your
submission and discovered
your story.

How reassuring it is to 
know that the future of
Western literature lies
squarely in monkey $#%&.

Angry Bob was sad.

"Bob, what is wrong," said the clown.

"I want to be happy. I will train myself to be happy."

Bob organized the "Food for Joy" seminar and handed out fliers which gave everyone kazoos and asked them to parade near the pandas and shout "foot for joy."

Even Bob signed up a sponsor, the global fast food chains, Mickey Donald''s.

On the rain day of the parade, the kazoos fell apart. They had come from China.

Except Bob, who stood in the middle of the street, with his kazoo, and a shirt that said, "Toot for Joy... Brought to You by Mickey Donald''s."

"I will not be stopped," thought Bob. "I will toot for joy alone."

So Bob began to march, and his face began to turn red, he began shouting "I will be happy," over and over again, until he dropped his kazoo and grabbed the barbed wire of a huge American global chain in the biggest anti-global brand plutocrat protest the planet had ever seen.

And there was Bob, with kazoos in his faces.

His Mickey Donald''s shirt.

Enraged, the mob attacked Bob. With each blow upon his person, Bob yelled, "I must be happy," until he fell unconscious, involuntarily blowing the kazoo and tooting for joy.

Many-toots-for-joy later, Bob died.

We interrupt today’s scheduled strip to bring you this announcement.

Late last evening, we received a letter from the attorneys for Scott Adams, who has been featured in this week’s series of strips.

The attorneys for Mr. Adams allege that Pearls has "falsely portrayed the Dilbert creator as a bizarre, obese, insatiable and reclusive Elvis impersonator who sends his behind the gates of his mansion shooting televisions, ripping his pants, and indulging in soliloquies, and is now legally liable." 

The attorneys for Mr. Adams have also asked that Stephan Pastis, the creator of the offending strips, issue a retraction in place of today''s strip.

In addition, the attorneys have demanded that the first two installments of this week''s strip be withdrawn from newspapers. According to the Elvis analogy in the attorneys'' request took the Elvis analogy to "an inappropriate extreme" by portraying Mr. Adams atop a toilet, whereupon he subsequently expired ignominiously of a drug overdose."

While the creator of Pearls will issue neither an apology nor a retraction, he has agreed to withhold a publication of the first two panels.

We rejoin the strip in progress.

Angry Bob was angry.

"My problem stems from women, I think!" Bob thought. "But why won''t women want to buy a women''s magazine like ''Cosmo''?"

Bob went to the grocery store and purchased a copy of ''Cosmopolitan'' magazine. He took it home and studied it in his backyard and read and read.

And heard a crash.

A Brazilian swimsuit model had fallen through his hedges.

"Excuse me," she said. "I am Lupe, and I have wandered away from a bikini contest and now I am lost. I have skimmed my knee falling through your hedge and am in need of water and your help but do not want to make it sound like I need you for help."

Bob stared at her in astonishment. He was utterly amazed. And so Bob stood up.

And the women''s magazine fell to the ground. 

And Lupe''s stare of utter astonishment slowly softened. And as she stared at Bob, she saw something she never saw before... a Cosmo in his hand. Lupe became enraged.

"AND THE WOMEN''S MAGAZINE!!" she roared. "YOU READ ''COSMO''!?!!"

Flummoxed, Bob panicked. "She reads ''The Atlantic'', doesn''t she?" he muttered.

RECENTLY, I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT YOUR THEME PARK.
I ENJOYED MYSELF GREATLY, EXCEPT FOR YOUR "IT''S A SMALL WORLD" RIDE.
DURING THE RIDE, LITTLE PEOPLE FROM EVERY COUNTRY HOLD HANDS AND SING SONGS.
BUT AS YOU MAY KNOW, THE WORLD TODAY DID NOT TURN OUT THE WAY MR. DISNEY HAD HOPED.
SO TO KEEP YOUR RIDE RELEVANT AND UP-TO-DATE WITH THE TIMES, I SUGGEST YOU SHOW THESE HARMONIOUS LITTLE MIDGETS BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF EACH OTHER.
THEY SHOULD PUMMEL EACH OTHER WITH STICKS, PUNCH EACH OTHER IN THE FACE, AND GENERALLY WHUP UP ON EACH OTHER IN TRUE SMALL WORLD-THAT-TURNS-OUT-LIKE-CRAP FASHION.
AND PLEASE CHANGE THE HAPPY MUSIC... I SUGGEST "KILLING IN THE NAME" BY RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE.
YOU KNOW, THAT''S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF LETTER THAT A BIG OL'' PLACE LIKE DISNEYLAND COULD INTERPRET AS A THREATENING NOTE, CAUSING YOU TO BE ARRESTED BY THE F.B.I... I SUGGEST YOU THINK OF A NICE, SAFE WAY OF CLOSING THE LETTER. . .

I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SYNDICATE IT.

YOU MAY BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I  
HAVE DONE IN COMICS RESEARCH AND AM FULLY AWARE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN SUBJECTS WHICH A COMIC STRIP TODAY MAY NOT MOCK...

THESE INCLUDE: RELIGION, RACE, ETHNICITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND ANY PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ILLNESS.

THIS OF COURSE MEANS THAT THE LAST GROUP OF PEOPLE WE CAN SAFELY MOCK IN AMERICA ARE FAT, BALD, DUMB GUYS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THAT STUPID MOUNTED FISH THAT SINGS.

Stephan Pastis is on vacation today. Filling in for him is his childhood friend, John Patzakis.

My name is John Patzakis. I have known Stephan since first grade.

His humor desperately punctures some kind and good soul, and he cannot seem to STOP. First, it was in the third grade when he whipped me with a towel after swimming in a YMCA pool. It was humiliating. Plus, when I got home, my mom didn’t believe my story.

NO ONE LIKES HIM!

You may ask, "Then why do you remain friends?" Simple answer. I feel sorry for his parents.

You see, growing up, Stephan was a skinny, obnoxious loser with super white teeth. Absolutely no focus in life. NONE.

He never made it onto his grade school sports team the first go round.
 

He tried out for a cross country and golf, which IS a sport, you know. Only to end up with long toenails and a mouthful of braces.

He played with Tsar Wars’ dolls and literally would press me at times to kiss a girl until college. (That’s when before kissing my wife.) 

Well, That’s all I can think of for now. If it got real quiet in here, I’ll just stroke the keyboard until I’ve caused Stephan told me I could share this AGAIN.

As some of you may know, the comic strip “Blondie” is celebrating its 75th Anniversary. Numerous characters from other comic strips were invited to participate.
The characters from “Pearls Before Swine” were not.
Such a slight may have been due to the popular misconception that “Pearls” is critical of older strips.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Why just look at this actual panel from a December, 2003 “Pearls” strip…

Angry Bob was angry.

Hey Bob! You won free flowers from the County Fair!

Angry Bob went to the address and knocked on the door.

It''s a small, well-lit, wholesome theme.

All praise be to the fairies!

Walking the shop, Bob saw fairies on rafters throwing flowers at customers. He hated flowers, and he hated fairies.

The more confused Bob got, the angrier he got.

Termed "The Fountain O'' Hope," it was a large fountain framed by hundreds of flowers, delivering Cupid''s gel, sprayed out of cherubim''s butts.

Bob made it to the fountain. He stared at a red-haired woman next to it. She appeared to be boiling in anger.

The woman screamed her entire life story at Bob, uninvited. Upon finishing, she ran away and screamed.

Reluctantly, the red-haired woman took the flower, sighed, smiled, and walked away.

Then, the spring gnomes surrounded Bob.

AND CRASHED INTO THE LARGE FOUNTAIN.

AND TO MY SURPRISE THE FOUNTAIN OF HOPE.

AND SCREAMED.

AND TO MY SURPRISE THE FOUNTAIN WAS NO HOPE.

PSYCHOLOGISTS BELIEVE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LACKS A CREATIVE OUTLET IS MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT A VIOLENT ACT... YOU, THE LIONS, HAVE NO CREATIVE OUTLET.

TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM, I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A FEW MOMENTS EACH DAY TO COMPOSE A POEM OR TWO... IT DOESN''T HAVE TO BE PARTICULARLY GOOD OR LONG... THE POINT IS REALLY JUST TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS DOWN ON PAPER.

Angry Bob was angry.

Angry Bob read People magazine. He saw happy, famous people.

The famous people said they were happy because they accepted an ancient religion.

"I will find an ancient religion," declared Angry Bob, "and then I shall be happy."

Angry Bob looked in his library. He found a book on religion. Closing his eyes, he flipped the pages and picked a God at random.

"Oh God," he prayed, "Do your magic. Work in my life."

"My God has sent me," he declared.

Bob grew curious. "Who is this God who can cure all the miracles? Who is this God that I have prayed to?"

Bob looked at the page he had picked:

"Malafistlis," it read,

"the God of Raining Vengeance Down Upon One''s Loved Ones."

A bookcase fell on Bob. He died.

Betty sat alone by the wind-swept airfield.

A dirigible floated just overhead.

He made him wait at the supermarket.

They made him wait in line at the amusement park.

So Danny Donkey cut the line.
Cut the line at the supermarket.
Cut the line at the amusement park.
Cut the line at the video store.

Why, Danny Donkey cut every line he could find.

But for everything we do, there are consequences. And this was no exception.

WHAT IS IT?

TWO PEOPLE. EACH IN CRAMPED CONDITIONS ON A PLANE. PERSON ‘A’ CAN EASE HIS DISCOMFORT BY RECLINING HIS SEAT.. BUT THERE’S A CATCH…

HIS INCREASED COMFORT CAN ONLY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF PERSON ‘B’ WHO IS FURTHER CRAMPED BY THE RECLINED SEAT IN FRONT OF HIM.

SO WHY WOULD PERSON ‘A’ DO IT?

BECAUSE THE AIRLINE SAYS HE CAN. AND HUMANS ARE INVARIABLY QUEUE-ING. PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY CAN, REGARDLESS OF ITS EFFECT ON OTHERS. AND THAT’S WHY THE WORLD IS IN THE STATE IT’S IN.

SO WHY DON’T YOU DO SOMETHING TO TRY AND CHANGE THAT?

Angry Bob was angry.

"I will fly a kite," he said.
"Flying a kite makes people happy."

So Angry Bob walked to the store.

"Hello," he said to the man at the store,
"I would like to purchase a kite." 

"I am sorry", said the man,
"but I am out of kites.
Perhaps you''d like a couch."

"A couch?" said Bob, "Why would
I want a couch?"

"Because couches are nice,"
said the man, "and they
make people happy."

Convinced, Bob bought the couch,
and tried to drive the 
store over his head.

Arriving at a field, he paused. "The man
was correct," thought Bob, "This couch
makes me feel happy." Bob then sat on
the first time in his 39 years, Bob smiled.

And threw it
into the air. 

And it did not fly. 

Bob was crushed
like a soft biscuit.

Sad because everyone around him was good-looking. And he was not.

So Danny Donkey went to a genie and asked to be good-looking.

"You asked to be good-looking"

"That is too much work on my part," said the genie, "But I can give you this."

And with that, the genie handed over what appeared to be some magical rod, and told Danny what it was and how to use it.

And so, later that day, Danny went out and hit every good-looking person he could find with his very own Ugly Stick.

He hated their music.

He hated their weekend plans. 
Their family photos.
And their unsolicited advice.

But most of all,
he hated their willingness
to whistle.

So Danny Donkey bought a "Bonk O'' Matic 2000" and gave each and every happy person he 
met one solid whack on the head.

Once upon a time, there was a bank C.E.O. who decided to make a lot of home loans to people who knew they could not pay them back.

As a result, Mr. Bank C.E.O. made $50,000,000 in bonuses and stock options.

But then the loans went bad.

And as a result, the bank''s shareholders lost $10,000,000,000.

And the bank''s homeowners lost their money.

And taxpayers with no connection to the bank had to pay all of the money to fix it.

And Mr. Bank C.E.O. got to keep all of his $50,000,000 and live happily ever after in his Connecticut mansion.

by Rat

Elly Elephant played with the blocks.

With these blocks, I will build something beautiful, she said...

I will build a block sculpture so wonderful that people will pause and weep.

And they will hug the person next to them. And the hugs will spread...

and there will be love.

And wars will end. And hate will fade. And all of humankind will realize through this one work of art that they have more in common than their countries and governments and religions and traditions have led them to believe.

Elly Elephant took a break from her blocks to watch the news.

So she approached her boyfriend, Henry Hippo.

Henry Hippo, I want you to take a poetry class. And I want you to do me in the iambic pentameter of Keats and Byron and Shelley.

So Henry Hippo went to school and learned the poetry of Keats and Byron and Shelley.

And worked late into the night on his own.

And when it was done, and as close to the work of the 19th century masters as could be, he presented it to his love, Elly Elephant...

...Who, touched beyond words, took the work gently into her hands and began to read.

Here are my wishes, please do the dishes,

So she put in one avocado for sensitivity, and one for handsome, and one for adventurous.

"And I want him to be dependable," she said, adding in another avocado. But when she did, out fell adventurous.

"Okay, he can''t be needy," she said, squeezing in another. But out fell sensitive.

"The basket can''t hold all the avocados," Elly cried in despair. "They are too many. I will learn to be happy with the one avocado I have."

So Danny Donkey bought a treehouse at a very tall tree.

"You should invite the entire neighborhood to a housewarming party," said Danny''s perky real estate agent. "Then you''ll have good relationships with all your neighbors."

So Danny Donkey invited all his neighbors to a housewarming party.

Which went well until he ran out of champagne.

YOU RUN OUT OF CHAMPAGNE! WE HATE YOU!

So Danny excused himself to buy more champagne.

And chopped down the tree.

"Now I have good relationships with all my neighbors," exclaimed Donny Donkey.

SO REMEMBER, KIDS, IT''S NOT GOOD FENCES THAT MAKE GOOD NEIGHBORS. IT''S DECEASED NEIGHBORS THAT MAKE GOOD NEIGHBORS.

So he went to see a life coach. 

"You worry too much," said the life coach, "And you lead a sedentary life. You need to travel, seek adventure, seize the day."

So Angry Bob booked a trip to New Zealand.
 
There he hiked volcanos, surfed waves, and decided to overcome his fear of bungee jumping. 

"Fear is stupid," he shouted from atop a high bridge as the bungee instructor attached the bungee cord to his leg.

"From now on, I’m going to live a new life! One where I seize the day!!" Angry Bob shouted as he jumped from the bridge...

...before the startled instructor could finish securing Bob''s cord.

But it doesn''t impress others.

It just makes them resentful.
